# Typerr
Touch typing practice app for keyboard masters to beginners 

# info
This is a web version of my previous electron application,
It does not require internet connection, its fine you can use it offline
(CLIENT SIDE JS)

Not to be used by non-physical keyboard devices, 
Get a hardware keyboard to practice typing.
Does'nt support smartphone's -yet-

# USE
No need to install or do anything to setup just open link, u r good to go.

## Happy typinggg..
